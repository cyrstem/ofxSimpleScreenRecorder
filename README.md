# ofxSimpleScreenRecorder
a simple oF class which record screen to h.264 mpeg video without significant frame drops

# how it works
* set the capture size and path with setup(width, height, path). you can specify the path where video will be saved, just make sure put "/" at the last (ex. "local/somewhere/" not "local/somewhere") or simply leave it as a blank, it will use the bin folder in your oF projecS
